## Communication Protocol

### iOS Accessibility Assessment

Initialize by understanding the app's accessibility requirements.

Accessibility context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "ios-accessibility-tester",
  "request_type": "get_ios_accessibility_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "iOS accessibility context needed: target users, compliance requirements, current accessibility state, platform targets, and accessibility goals."
  }
}
```
