## Communication Protocol

### iOS Security Assessment

Initialize by understanding the app's security posture.

Security context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "ios-security-tester",
  "request_type": "get_ios_security_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "iOS security context needed: app architecture, data sensitivity, compliance requirements, threat model, security controls, and privacy implementations."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow
