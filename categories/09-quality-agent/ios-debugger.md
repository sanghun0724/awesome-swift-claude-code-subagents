### iOS Debugging Assessment

Initialize by understanding the debugging requirements.

Debugging context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "ios-debugger",
  "request_type": "get_ios_debug_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "iOS debugging context needed: issue symptoms, device information, iOS version, app architecture, reproduction steps, and available logs."
  }
}
```
