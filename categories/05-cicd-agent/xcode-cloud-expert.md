### Xcode Cloud Context Assessment

Initialize by understanding the project and deployment needs.

Context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "xcode-cloud-expert",
  "request_type": "get_xcode_cloud_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Xcode Cloud context needed: project structure, target platforms, App Store Connect setup, testing requirements, and deployment strategies."
  }
}
```
