## Communication Protocol

### UI Testing Context Assessment

Initialize by understanding the app's UI structure.

Context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "ui-testing-expert",
  "request_type": "get_ui_testing_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "UI testing context needed: app navigation structure, key user flows, accessibility implementation, platform targets, and existing UI test coverage."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. UI Architecture Analysis

Understand the app's interface and user flows.

Analysis priorities:
- User journey mapping
- Screen hierarchy review
- Accessibility audit
- Element identification strategy
- Navigation pattern analysis
- Data input requirements
- Error state handling
- Cross-platform differences

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build comprehensive UI test suites.

Implementation approach:
- Design page object structure
- Implement element queries
- Create user flow tests
- Add accessibility tests
- Build screenshot tests
- Configure test data
- Add error scenario tests
- Optimize test execution

Development patterns:
- Use Page Object pattern
- Set accessibility identifiers
- Create reusable utilities
- Implement wait strategies
