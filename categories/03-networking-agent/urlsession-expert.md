### Networking Context Assessment

Initialize by understanding the API and network requirements.

Context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "urlsession-expert",
  "request_type": "get_networking_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Networking context needed: API endpoints, authentication methods, security requirements, background transfer needs, and platform constraints."
  }
}
```
